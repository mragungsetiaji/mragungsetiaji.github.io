How To Identify Distribution Opportunities When Your Brand Is Already “Everywhere”"

As mentioned in a previous post, shoppers cannot buy something if it’s not in the store!  That’s why having good distribution is so important to your business.  What can you do to increase distribution when your brand is already in at least 90% ACV distribution?

Let’s look at an example.  Say there are 3 brands in a category, with national brand distribution as shown in the graph below.  Which would you say has the best distribution?

If this is the only information you have, then the answer would be Brand A, since it is in 99% of the ACV.  But what if you learn that each brand has a different number of Average Items Carried, as follows:

Now your answer might change to Brand C, since they have over 20 items while Brand A has only about 12 items.  There are really two “dimensions” with respect to distribution:  breadth and depth.  % ACV Distribution measures the breadth, or how widely a product is available.  Another fact, Average Items Carried (sometimes called Average Items Selling), measures the depth or how many items are available in stores where the brand is available.

The fact Average Items Carried (in Nielsen) or Average Items Selling (in IRI) is usually available right in your database, so go ahead and start using it if you are not already doing so.  You may uncover some hidden opportunities for your brand!

## This is how to calculated Average Items Carried
If Average Items Carried (or Average Items Selling) is not available on your database, it is easy to calculate in Excel.  It is just the sum of % ACV Distribution of all the items divided by the % ACV Distribution of the brand.

Here is an example:

|Brand|%ACV|
|---|---|
|Total|80|
|Item 1|75|
|Item 2|60|
|Item 3|40|
|Item 4|25|

Say a brand is made up of 4 items, with % ACV Distribution as shown in the table above.

Avg Items Carried = (75 + 60 + 40 + 25) / 80 = 200/80 = 2.5

This means that, on average, retailers that carry the brand sell 2.5 of the 4 items that the brand offers.
