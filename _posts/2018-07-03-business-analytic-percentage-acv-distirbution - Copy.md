You probably consider dollars the most important measure and it IS the bottom line.  But the number one driver of dollar sales is distribution.  After all, shoppers cannot buy something that’s not in the store!

Used properly, % ACV Distribution will give you the answer to crucial business questions like:

- Are there any retailers that are not carrying our #1 item?
- Are we meeting the distribution goals we set for our new product?  Which retailers are selling at least one of the new items?
- My broker is saying sales are down because we are losing distribution.  How can I tell if this is true?  What is really happening in the stores?
- So what exactly does % ACV Distribution mean and how is it calculated?

% ACV Distribution is often just abbreviated “% ACV,” especially when talking about it verbally.  It can generally be thought of as “% of stores selling,” but with stores weighted based on their size.  In other words,  you get more credit for being in larger stores than in smaller ones.  The size of a store is based on annual sales of everything the store sells, called All Commodity Volume.  When Nielsen and IRI calculate ACV, they don’t count things like pharmacy, lottery, and gasoline since not all stores have those features.

% ACV Distribution is calculated as the dollar value of stores in which a product has scanned in a geography divided by the dollar value of all the stores in that geography.  Let’s repeat that:  A product must scan in a store for it to count as being in distribution there. If it is on the shelf but does not sell or it is supposed to be there but is out of stock, it doesn’t count as being in distribution. In this picture, this retailer is out of stock on several items.  Even though there are shelf tags for these items, in Nielsen and IRI, these products are not counted as “in distribution” because they won’t scan at the register.

Here is an example of how % ACV is calculated.  Let’s say Anytown USA is made up of 3 retailers, as follows:

||# Toko|ACV Rp|% Toko|%ACV Rp|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|A Foods|60|200M|30%|50%|
|B Foods|40|40M|20%|10%|
|C Foods|100|160M|50%|40%|
|Total|200|400M|100%|100%|

If Brand A has scanned in Fun Foods and Smart Stores, then it is in 80% of the stores (30+50), but has 90% ACV Distribution (50+40).

So just remember, % ACV is like % of stores selling but you get more credit for big stores than small ones.

% ACV Distribution is a really basic measure but it can be tricky to use in analysis.  Here are the 5 most important things to remember about % ACV Distribution:

1. It gets triggered by a SCAN, not by whether the product is actually sitting on the shelf right this second.   Just because a retailer has authorized a product, it does not mean that the product is available in all of its stores so that people can buy it.  Distribution is measured by IRI/Nielsen when a product is actually scanned in a store.
2. % ACV Distribution cannot be added across products, markets or periods!  You must use the products, markets or periods available on your database otherwise the measure is incorrect.  (You would know this quickly when distribution shows up as greater than 100%!).  This is known in the biz as a non-additive fact.
3. Unless your product is perishable, it is best to look at distribution for periods longer than a single week.  The longer the purchase cycle for your product, the longer that period should be.  For example, if people tend to buy your category only a few times per year and the product does not “expire,” it is possible that the product is in distribution but has not scanned in a week.  This is highly unlikely at the Total US  and market levels, but can occur at the retailer level, especially for a specific item.  For most frequently-purchased products, I recommend looking at the most recent 4-week distribution and for slower-moving products the most recent 12-week.
4. Be careful when looking at 52-week distribution numbers.  For long periods that are aggregated from smaller chunks, distribution can be calculated as either the average or the maximum over all the weeks in the period.  You can see how this does not give an accurate representation of current distribution if a product’s distribution is growing or declining, rather than relatively stable.
5. Don’t be alarmed when distribution of individual items is not as high as the total brand distribution – that is normal!  Distribution for a single item will almost always be lower than it is for the total brand because not all stores will carry all varieties of your product. Exceptions to this would be key items that are literally everywhere, for example white Kleenex tissues 10oz box, Kraft macaroni & cheese 7 ¼ oz, and 2-liter Diet Coke.
