Every place, always left a memorable thing. And I learned that what I might say now that something isn’t likely to happen in the future, now it turns out to be real. In every office I go through there will be a moment that makes me not stop to think about, from some history that I had, become it interesting to remember in every step I toward the future, that until now I have not found a fixed clear point by a definition.

She's 3 years older than me and I don’t believe that my habit of ignoring others doesn’t work for her.

Outliers have always been the keywords inherent in my understanding that if the outlier is in the right place, it will be infinite value. I feel that I've always been an outlier, although I've not been in a position that has an important role and I see she is also one of the outliers with different profile. Among the dozens of red flowers in a cluster of garden, she was redder in color and I could clearly see her from the end of the road with a considerable distance, so she wasn't aware there was an observer who saw her happily.

If anyone asks me, Why you're not going to try to cross the street and try to get in for a closer look?

I say no, not all what you want it will be yours, every step in the endless path will always be beautiful things around it, but do you want to stop walking and take every beautiful thing and you know that it isn't your own, then what are you going to put aside in your selfish pursuit, remember I'm not a child who always has what I want and when I got it, I'll throw it away because it is just a moment of emotional desire, I've quite often feel it.

I enjoy this process and I want to make sure it's not a moment of emotional desire, it's a real sense of awe, a sense of awe that makes me happy. That's how I'm thankful for what God gave to me.
